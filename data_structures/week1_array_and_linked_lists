[Time complexity]

time complexity estimates how an algorithm performs regardless kind of machine it runs on.

O(1) - Constant Time
: takes the same amount of time to compute regardless of the input size.

O(n) - Linear time
: the program visits every element from the input.

O(n^2) - Quadratic time

O(n^c) - Polynomial time

O(log n) - Logarithmic time
ex, binary search

O(n log n) - Linearithmic

O(n log n) - Linearithmic

O(2^n) - Exponential time
O(n!) - Factorial time
